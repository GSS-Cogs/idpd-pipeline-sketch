# Python Pipeline Sketch

An initial go and working our the methods, functions and general flow of a python only data ingress pipeline.

I've written this ina  Jupyter notebook, to run it in this fashion, clone this repo and:

```python
pipenv syv
pipenv run jupyter lab
```

The functions and methods are either empty or returning the minimal hard coded return. The intention here is to just work out the skeleton of what pytonh-only pipeline code in such a way that it makes sense regardless of the runner that's used to power the pipeline.

You should be able to follow the logic by reading though pipeline.ipynb.
